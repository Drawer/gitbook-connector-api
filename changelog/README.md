# ACTION REQUIRED!

We have changed the URLs for our API. The old URLs with `mews.li` are no longer operational, instead you should be using:
* `api.mews.com` for the endpoints
* `ws.mews.com` for websockets

For more details, see [Environments](../guidelines/environments.md).

# Changelog

## 7th March 2022 11:20 UTC

# Taxation

## Legal environments and Tax codes

Each legal environment includes a different set of hard coded tax codes in Mews. Tax codes are used to allow Mews to integrate items’ amounts and tax breakdowns in relation to the received net/gross amounts accurately. If no tax codes are used, then Mews will not calculate the tax breakdown. It expected from integrations to forward the correct tax codes in combination with net or gross amounts.  

Note that tax environments are subject to change depending on the local government’s ruling. It is expected that integration partners act independently and pull updated information from Mews. In turn, Mews will keep the legal environment and tax codes up to date. 

## Implementation of Tax codes 

The integration should use the following endpoints to retrieve a property’s tax codes.  

* [configuration/get](../operations/configuration.md#get-configuration) to retrieve `TaxEnvironmentsCode` that applies to the relevant property.

* [taxEnvironments/getAll](../operations/configuration.md#get-all-tax-environments) to retrieve all `TaxationCodes` within the relevant tax environment of the property. 

* [taxations/getAll](../operations/configuration.md#get-all-taxations) to retrieve the specific TaxRatesCodes and their `Value`

## Tax exempt items

Tax exempt items should include the tax code value `null`. This will lead to Mews not including any tax breakdown. Legal environments in which no actual 0% tax rate exists do not have a 0% tax code in Mews.  

## Multi-tax environment

Multi-tax environments have instances in which a combination of taxes is applied. In those cases, Mews does not use a single composite tax code but expects that all relevant tax codes are forwarded.  

```javascript
"TaxCodes": [ 
    "US-MA-S, 
    US-MA-EXCISE-0.75%" 
]
```

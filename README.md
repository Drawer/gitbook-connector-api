# Introduction

Welcome to the __Mews Connector API__. This is a general-purpose API that enables partners of Mews to access data and services in __Mews Operations__.

The API is typically consumed by cloud applications that work with the data of hotels and other properties hosted in Mews, e.g. revenue management systems and cloud-based point-of-sale systems.
It can also be used by applications that are running on-premise to mediate communication between Mews and local devices, e.g. en-premise point-of-sale systems, self-service kiosks and physical devices such as printers.

As your first step to using the API, you will want to get familiar with the [Guidelines](guidelines/) which describe how to get started communicating with the API.
All API endpoints are detailed in [Operations](operations/), see also [Websockets](websockets/) and [Webhooks](webhooks/) for other ways to communicate.
For guidance on using the API for different scenarios, have a look at the [Use cases](use-cases/) which will help you through your implementation.
